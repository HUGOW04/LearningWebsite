  {
  "question": "What is the difference between Information Security, IT Security, and Cybersecurity?",
  "answer": "Information Security protects all forms of information, whether digital or physical. IT Security focuses on protecting IT systems and networks. Cybersecurity specifically defends computers, networks, and data from attacks originating from the internet."
  },
  {
  "question": "How does fraud differ from a network attack?",
  "answer": "Fraud involves deception to gain unauthorized benefits, often targeting people or financial systems. A network attack targets computer networks to disrupt, damage, or steal data from systems."
  },
  {
  "question": "Give an example of how a network attack can lead to fraud.",
  "answer": "An attacker might use a phishing attack (a type of network attack) to steal login credentials, then use those credentials to commit fraud such as unauthorized transactions or identity theft."
  },
  {
  "question": "Explain the CIA Triad in your own words.",
  "answer": "The CIA Triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It means keeping data private (Confidentiality), accurate and unchanged (Integrity), and accessible when needed (Availability). These are the core principles of information security."
  },
  {
  "question": "Why is data encryption important for confidentiality?",
  "answer": "Data encryption transforms information into a coded format that only authorized users can read, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and ensuring confidentiality."
  },
  {
  "question": "What are the three states of data, and how do they affect security?",
  "answer": "The three states of data are: Data at Rest (stored data), Data in Transit (data being transmitted), and Data in Use (data currently processed). Each state requires protection to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or loss."
  },
  {
  "question": "What security measures can help protect data in motion? Network Attacks & Threats",
  "answer": "Security measures like encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL), secure VPNs, and strong authentication protect data in motion by preventing interception, tampering, and unauthorized access during transmission."
  },
  {
  "question": "What is social engineering, and why is it dangerous?",
  "answer": "Social engineering is a manipulation technique where attackers trick people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. It is dangerous because it exploits human trust rather than technical vulnerabilities."
  },
  {
  "question": "Describe how a phishing attack works.",
  "answer": "A phishing attack tricks victims into clicking malicious links or providing sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy source, often via email or fake websites."
  },
  {
  "question": "What makes spear phishing different from normal phishing?",
  "answer": "Spear phishing targets specific individuals or organizations with personalized messages, making it more convincing and harder to detect than general phishing attacks."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the quid pro quo attack in simple terms.",
    "answer": "A quid pro quo attack involves an attacker offering a service or benefit in exchange for information or access, tricking victims into cooperating."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does pretexting trick people into giving up sensitive information?",
    "answer": "Pretexting involves creating a fake scenario or identity to gain trust and convince people to share confidential information."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is privilege escalation, and how can it be prevented?",
    "answer": "Privilege escalation is when an attacker gains higher access rights than allowed. It can be prevented by applying patches, using least privilege, and monitoring systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the difference between DoS and DDoS attacks.",
    "answer": "A DoS attack comes from one source to overwhelm a target, while a DDoS attack uses many compromised systems to flood the target, making it harder to block."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) difficult to detect?",
    "answer": "APTs are stealthy, long-term attacks by skilled attackers who carefully avoid detection and maintain access over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four components of IAAA (Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability)?",
    "answer": "Identification is claiming an identity; Authentication verifies it; Authorization grants access rights; Accountability tracks user actions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Give an example of how multi-factor authentication (MFA) improves security.",
    "answer": "MFA requires multiple proofs, like a password plus a fingerprint, making it much harder for attackers to gain access."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three types of authentication? Provide an example for each.",
    "answer": "Knowledge-based (password), possession-based (security token), and inherence-based (fingerprint)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are strong passwords not enough for secure authentication?",
    "answer": "Passwords can be stolen, guessed, or reused; additional factors reduce the risk of unauthorized access."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the least privilege principle, and why is it important?",
    "answer": "It means users get only the access they need to perform tasks, limiting damage if accounts are compromised."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the difference between DAC, MAC, and RBAC in access control.",
    "answer": "DAC lets owners decide access; MAC is system-enforced with strict policies; RBAC assigns access based on user roles."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) work?",
    "answer": "ABAC grants access based on attributes like user role, time, location, or device used."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is non-repudiation, and how does it improve security?",
    "answer": "Non-repudiation ensures a user cannot deny their actions, often by using digital signatures or logs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does SIEM stand for, and why is it useful in cybersecurity?",
    "answer": "SIEM means Security Information and Event Management; it collects and analyzes security data to detect threats."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do security teams use SIEM tools to detect attacks?",
    "answer": "They monitor logs and alerts from multiple sources to identify suspicious behavior and respond quickly."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an audit trail, and how does it help with accountability?",
    "answer": "An audit trail records actions in systems, helping trace who did what and when."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is logging important in network security?",
    "answer": "Logging helps detect, investigate, and prevent security incidents by keeping records of activities."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should an organization do after detecting a security breach?",
    "answer": "They should contain the breach, analyze the cause, fix vulnerabilities, notify affected parties, and improve defenses."
  },
  {
    "question": "Imagine you are a network administrator. What are three things you would do to secure a company network?",
    "answer": "Implement firewalls and IDS/IPS, enforce strong access controls, and regularly update and patch systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "If you received an email asking for your login details, how would you check if it's a phishing attempt?",
    "answer": "Check the sender's email, look for spelling errors, avoid clicking links, and verify requests through official channels."
