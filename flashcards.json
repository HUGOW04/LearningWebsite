    "question": "What is a baseline?",
    "answer": "A baseline is a reference point that defines what 'normal' behavior or performance looks like in a system or process. By understanding what is typical, it's easier to identify when something is abnormal. For example, if a process normally takes a certain number of seconds to complete, but suddenly takes much longer, it signals that something might be wrong. Having a baseline allows you to track changes over time, identify issues, and compare the current state with previous normal performance to pinpoint what might have changed or caused delays."
